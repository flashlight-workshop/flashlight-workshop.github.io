Welcome to the FLASHLIGHT workshop, which will be held at [FCCM'22](https://www.fccm.org).

The workshop concerns the application of formal methods to the HLS process. “Formal methods” is a
fairly broad term that can refer to any mathematically rigorous techniques for specifying and
verifying computer systems; it includes proof assistants, static analysers, automatic verifiers, and
formal semantics.
