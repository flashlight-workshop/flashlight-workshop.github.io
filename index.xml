High-level synthesis (HLS) is a particularly compelling solution, as it promises to make the computational power and energy efficiency of FPGAs available to software engineers without a background in hardware design. There has, accordingly, been a huge amount of HLS research in recent years, much of which has been presented at FCCM and the other F-conferences.</description></item></channel></rss>
